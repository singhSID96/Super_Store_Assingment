# Super_Store_Assingment
As a Sales Manager at Superstore Sales, one of Canadaâ€™s largest retail chains, you are tasked with preparing a Corporate Customer Segment Sales Report for management review. Using the dataset superstore_sales.xlsx, you will filter and extract only the Corporate segment data, clean and format it for clarity, and present it in a structured, professional manner.

The report involves:

Basic formatting (adjusting column widths, styling headers, adding borders)

Filtering and organizing data into separate sheets for each customer segment

Data refinement (freezing headers, hiding unwanted columns, rounding values, and formatting dates, sales, and profits)

Sorting and highlighting top-performing sales within regions and applying profit/loss conditional formatting

Enhancing readability by adding visual separators for each region

Preparing a print-ready version, securing it with password protection, and exporting it as a PDF for easy sharing
